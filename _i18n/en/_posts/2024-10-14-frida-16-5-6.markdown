Quick bug-fix release to further improve our Fruity backend, where [@hsorbo][]
and I filled up our coffee cups and hammered out the following fixes:

- fruity: Fix use-after-free in TcpConnection. The error callback might be
  called at a point where the PCB has already been freed. This meant that us
  clearing its user data would result in a use-after-free where a NULL pointer
  was written into the unknown.
- fruity: Fix DTXArgumentList.parse() GValue init, where we were using the wrong
  setter when encountering an object. This was caught by GLib's runtime checks,
  but went unnoticed because we usually build without them.
- payload: Fix an AddressSanitizer build regression.
