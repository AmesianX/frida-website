Exciting new release packed with improvements and new features across platforms.
Here's what's new:

#### Fruity Backend Improvements

[@hsorbo][] and I have been working hard to enhance our Fruity backend, and
we're excited to share the following improvements:

- **Added support for the TCP tunnel protocol** and made it the default to match
  Apple's new behavior. The `FRIDA_FRUITY_TUNNEL_PROTOCOL` environment variable
  can be used to revert back to QUIC.
- **Fixed edge-case in tunnel logic for older OS versions**, ensuring reliable
  operation even when `usbmuxd` is not available.
- **Gracefully closed `TunnelConnection`** to improve stability.
- **Fixed a hang that could occur when a USB operation starts during teardown**,
  preventing transfers from getting stuck.
- **Fixed `QuicTunnelConnection` teardown logic**, properly handling errors
  during close operations.
- **Relaxed NCM interface presence check**, requiring only one operational
  network interface.
- **Adjusted to always try USB transport first**, as network transport may be
  slower or unavailable.
- **Improved handling of timeout cases** when skipping jailed fallback.
- **Now expect networked devices to respond quickly** when connecting to the
  pairing service, improving the user experience when a device has gone to sleep.
- **Fixed `CoreDevice` UDID logic** for modern devices.

#### Android

- **Gadget now supports loading assets from APKs when `extractNativeLibs` is set to
  `false`**, improving compatibility with modern Android apps (thanks to
  [@gergesh][]).
- **Revived injector's handling of shared `libc` ranges**, ensuring correct
  behavior when the target process's lowest `libc.so` range is a shared mapping
  (thanks to [@lx866][]).

#### Linux

- **Improved injector's compatibility with MUSL**, handling differences in the
  loader string (thanks to [@luckycat889][]).
- **Added support for overriding configuration when building helpers**, allowing
  for greater flexibility in builds (thanks to [@luckycat889][]).
- **Allocated stack for injector's remote calls**, improving compatibility with
  programs using small stacks, such as Go applications (thanks to
  [@ajwerner][]).
- **Added CI that rebuilds helper binaries** to ensure consistency between
  source and checked-in binaries (thanks to [@ajwerner][]).
- **Picked alternative temporary directories when `$TMPDIR` is `noexec`**

#### Cross-platform

- **Added support for non-UTF-8 locales** in the build system, ensuring better
  compatibility on systems with various locale settings (thanks to
  [@JunGe-Y][]).
- **Added support for the PowerPC architecture** in the build system.
- **Added support for binary data handling** in `frida-inject` and RpcClient
  internals.

Happy hacking!
